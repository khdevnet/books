# Code Complete
### Chapter 22 Testing
* Unit testing is the execution of a complete class, routine, or small program that has been written by a single programmer or team of programmers, which is
tested in isolation from the more complete system.
* Component testing is the execution of a class, package, small program, or other program element that involves the work of multiple programmers or
programming teams, which is tested in isolation from the more complete system.
* Integration testing is the combined execution of two or more classes, packages, components, or subsystems that have been created by multiple programmers or
programming teams. This kind of testing typically starts as soon as there are two classes to test and continues until the entire system is complete.
* Regression testing is the repetition of previously executed test cases for the purpose of finding defects in software that previously passed the same set of
tests.
* System testing is the execution of the software in its final configuration, including integration with other software and hardware systems. It tests for
security, performance, resource loss, timing problems, and other issues that can't be tested at lower levels of integration.
